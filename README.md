# LL_Reverse
LL_Reverse finished :
-> contains methods for reversing LL (both iterative and recursive approach)
-> contains print methods that use recursion, to print list both forwards and backwards
-> to support creating a list, files have to be added from LL Project
-> the head is defined globally, and is also declared in the header file as an extern variable
-> the struct is defined in the .c file
-> the primary methods are accessing the global-defined head, by using an extern head declaration in the header file
