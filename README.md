# LL_Reverse
LL finished :
-> contains insert and delete methods for inserting and deleting nodes in LL
-> the insert and delete methods take (struct node *head) from the main method as argument, edit the list, and hence return (struct node *head) back to the main
-> no extern head declaration required in header file to access head, since there is no global head definition
-> either .h file or .c file must contain struct definition, and since we include .h file in the main method, struct definition not required in main method
-> also included is an iterative print method
